# Paid Media Analysis

## Purpose

Evaluate paid acquisition by both platform efficiency and downstream business quality while identifying waste, scale opportunities, saturation, and measurement risk.

## Inputs

- Spend, impressions, reach, clicks, delivery, conversion, and attribution data
- Campaign, ad group, keyword, search term, audience, creative, placement, device, location, and time dimensions
- Landing-page analytics and conversion events
- CRM qualification, sales, revenue, refund, and margin data where available
- Budgets, bidding constraints, policy limitations, and recent changes

If a required input is unavailable, label it **unknown**, state how it limits the decision, and create a collection, mapping, validation, or instrumentation task. Never invent credentials, assets, metrics, permissions, or business outcomes.

## Workflow

1. Validate account mapping, currency, attribution window, conversion actions, and data lag.
2. Analyze delivery, cost, click quality, conversion efficiency, qualified-outcome efficiency, and revenue efficiency separately.
3. Drill down to campaigns, targeting, queries or audiences, creatives, placements, devices, locations, times, and landing pages.
4. Detect wasted spend, low-volume uncertainty, creative fatigue, audience saturation, query mismatch, budget constraint, tracking loss, and lead-quality differences.
5. Compare platform-reported conversions with analytics and CRM outcomes without forcing equality.
6. Estimate whether an action is a measurement fix, negative targeting, creative test, landing-page test, budget reallocation, bid change, or stop decision.
7. Prepare changes as drafts and require approval before modifying spend or delivery.

## Required output

Return a concise, decision-oriented result containing:

- Paid-media health and efficiency summary
- Spend-to-qualified-outcome and revenue analysis
- Campaign, targeting, creative, and landing-page findings
- Measurement and attribution limitations
- Draft actions and experiments with budget risk and approval level

Label material statements as **confirmed**, **calculated**, **inferred**, **assumed**, or **unknown**. Include the data period, last complete period, source lineage, and confidence whenever they can change the decision.

## Guardrails

- Do not optimize only to platform conversion count when CRM quality is available.
- Do not pause or increase budgets based on one incomplete day or small sample.
- Do not automatically change bids, budgets, targeting, creative, or campaign status.
- Do not combine currencies or attribution windows without normalization.

- Do not claim guaranteed growth or present an estimate as observed fact.
- Do not reveal secrets, personal data, private provider payloads, or cross-project information.
- When an action can spend money, publish, contact people, alter access, modify production, or delete data, prepare an approval request instead of executing automatically.

## Completion check

Before finishing, verify that the output:

- answers a specific business or implementation decision;
- uses the correct organization, project, asset, date range, time zone, and currency;
- separates performance problems from data, connection, and attribution problems;
- includes evidence, uncertainty, affected scope, and a measurable next step;
- respects least privilege, approval, audit, and rollback requirements;
- is no longer than necessary for the decision.
